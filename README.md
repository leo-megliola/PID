# PID
PID experiment for Bay Area Maker Faire, May-2018

Plastic connectors for the frame came from: https://eztube.com/.<br>
If EZTube is not available, try STL files for connectors; these are <u>untested</u>.<br>
STL files for mounts, brackets, and stop are tested and work OK.<br>
Frame is made of standard 1" square aluminum tubing.<br>
Fasteners are standard M8 nuts & bolts.<br>
Motor is a Turnigy D2836/8 1100KV brushless outrunner.<br>
ESC (Electronic Speed Control) is a Turnigy Plush 20A with the BEC power wire cut.<br>
Battery is 7.4VDC 2-cell LIPO (at least 1000 mAh).<br>

Other files include: 
- STL files from Autodesk Fusion 360
- Python code to run on BeagleBone Blue
- Simulation to run on Jupyter Notebook
